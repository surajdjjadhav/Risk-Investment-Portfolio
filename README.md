# Risk-Investment-Portfolio  



## Project Overview:  
Investment Risk Management Portfolio Analysis  
This project aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the investment potential and risk associated with a selection of prominent Indian companies. By utilizing key financial metrics and analytical tools, the project seeks to guide investment decisions and optimize portfolio performance.    



## 1. Objectives   

### . Evaluate Investment Potential:   
   Analyze the performance and growth potential of selected companies using financial metrics such as average returns and CAPM required returns. 

### . Assess Risk:   
  Measure and assess the risk associated with each investment using standard deviation, beta, and other risk indicators.  

### . Optimize Portfolio Allocation:   
   Develop a strategy for allocating investments across companies to balance risk and return effectively.

## 3. Financial Metrics  

### 3.1 Average Return:  
•	The mean of all the returns generated by an investment or portfolio over a specific period. It provides a measure of the central tendency of the returns.
Formula - **=AVERAGE(range of compney return %)**  

### 3.2 Risk (Standard Deviation, SD):  
•	A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given investment or portfolio. It indicates the volatility or risk associated with the investment. A higher standard deviation means more volatility. 
  Formula - **=STDEV(Range of Return %)**   

### 3.3 Beta:  
•	A measure of an investment's sensitivity to market movements. A beta greater than 1 indicates the investment is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 indicates it is less volatile.  
Formula - **=SLOPE(Range of return % of compney ,Range of return % of NSE)**      

**Types of Beta**  
**1. Positive Beta**: Indicates that the investment's returns move in the same direction as the market.  
**2. Negative Beta**: Indicates that the investment's returns move in the opposite direction to the market.  
**3. Beta of 1:** This implies the investment’s returns move in perfect correlation with the market.  
**4. beta of 0:** Implies no correlation with the market   

### 3.4 Risk-Free Return (RF):  
•	The theoretical return of an investment with zero risk, typically represented by government bonds or treasury bills. It serves as a benchmark for evaluating other investments.  
**risk-free rate (Rf) = 6.07%**  

### 3.5 Total Days Count:  
•	The number of days over which the returns are calculated. It's used in various calculations, including converting returns to different time periods.  
Formula **=COUNTA(Range Of Total Working Days)**

### 3.6 Actual Return:  
•	The percentage return that an investment or portfolio generates over a year. It can be calculated by compounding daily, monthly, or other periodic returns over the year. 
Formula - **(Total Days * Average return % of compney)**  

### 3.7 Actual  Return of NSE (RM):  
•	The annual return of the NSE (National Stock Exchange) index, which represents the market's average return. It's often used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of other investments.  
Formula -**(Total Days * Average  return % of NSE)**

### 3.8 CAPM Required Return:  
•	The expected return on an investment according to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).  
It's calculated as:
CAPM  Required Return= **RF+β×(RM−RF)** 
  
where RF is the risk-free rate,  
RM is the market return,     
β is the investment's beta.     
This model helps in determining the appropriate return for the risk taken.

## 5. Findings  
 •	Highest Annual Return: **Tata Motors** Ltd with **71.30%.**   
 •	Lowest Risk: **Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd** at **1.30%.**  
 •	Investment Allocation: **Tata Motors Ltd** received the **highest** allocation at 25%.  


## 6. Risk Management Strategy  
The portfolio is diversified across companies with different risk and return profiles to optimize returns while mitigating risks.  


## 7. Conclusion
