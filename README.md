# Risk-Investment-Portfolio  



## Project Overview:  
Investment Risk Management Portfolio Analysis  
This project aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the investment potential and risk associated with a selection of prominent Indian companies. By utilizing key financial metrics and analytical tools, the project seeks to guide investment decisions and optimize portfolio performance.    



## Objectives   

### 1. Evaluate Investment Potential:   
   Analyze the performance and growth potential of selected companies using financial metrics such as average returns and CAPM required returns.    

### 2. Assess Risk:   
  Measure and assess the risk associated with each investment using standard deviation, beta, and other risk indicators.  

### 3. Optimize Portfolio Allocation:   
   Develop a strategy for allocating investments across companies to balance risk and return effectively.

## 3. Financial Metrics  

### 1.	Average Return:  
•	The mean of all the returns generated by an investment or portfolio over a specific period. It provides a measure of the central tendency of the returns.

### 2.	Risk (Standard Deviation, SD):  
•	A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given investment or portfolio. It indicates the volatility or risk associated with the investment. A higher standard deviation means more volatility.  

### 3.	Beta:  
•	A measure of an investment's sensitivity to market movements. A beta greater than 1 indicates the investment is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 indicates it is less volatile.  

### 4.	Risk-Free Return (RF):  
•	The theoretical return of an investment with zero risk, typically represented by government bonds or treasury bills. It serves as a benchmark for evaluating other investments.  

### 5.	Total Days Count:  
•	The number of days over which the returns are calculated. It's used in various calculations, including converting returns to different time periods.

### 6.	Annual Return:  
•	The percentage return that an investment or portfolio generates over a year. It can be calculated by compounding daily, monthly, or other periodic returns over the year.  

### 7.	Annual Return of NSE (RM):  
•	The annual return of the NSE (National Stock Exchange) index, which represents the market's average return. It's often used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of other investments.  

### 8.	CAPM Required Return:  
•	The expected return on an investment according to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).  
It's calculated as:
CAPM  Required Return= **RF+β×(RM−RF)** 
  
where RF is the risk-free rate, RM is the market return, and β is the investment's beta.   
This model helps in determining the appropriate return for the risk taken.
